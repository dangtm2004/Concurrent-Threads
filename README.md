# Concurrent Threads
 
Using POSIX threads, mutex locks, and semaphores implement a solution that synchronizes the
activities of the coordinator, tutors, and the students.

The total number of students, the number of tutors, the number of chairs, and the number of times
a student seeks a tutorâ€™s help are passed as command line arguments as shown below (csmc is the
name of the executable):

csmc #students #tutors #chairs #help

To run: csmc 10 3 4 5
